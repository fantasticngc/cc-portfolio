       Work Description: 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the users use this experimental camera, it is important for them to choose whether open the device's camera. Hence, the consentful interface serves as an information introduction to inform users about the program.
    </p>

   <h1>
      Design Process
    </h1>
    <p>
      First, I drew a flowchart to show the process when users need to understand the information.
    </p>
   <p>
     The flowchart is below.

  First, I think I need to tell the main purpose of my experimental camera. So the first interface is the introduction to the Sichuan opera bianlian. If the user does not agree with using the camera and still wants to experience the process of changing faces, there would be a choice to show some pictures about Sichuan opera. And for those who want to see the pictures and experience the camera both, they can still choose to see the pictures and then go back to the main menu to choose next step.
</p>
<p>
  Then, the second consentful interface is to clarify what information will be collected from the users. Hence, on this step, users still have the right to choose not to open their camera. Only when they agree with the statement, then they can experience the Sichuan opera and change their faces. Besides, when the users are using their cameras, they can turn off the cameras as well and come back to the main menu as FRIES emphasises that the consentful interface should be reversible at anytime.
</p>
    
<h1>
  Reflection
</h1>
<p>
  In this assignment, the consentful interface reminds me of some details we may not notice when we design some interactions with users. Sometimes, we only focus on the design itself but ignore the importance of users' feelings when they use it. It is even more vital than the design work itself whether our design forces the users to agree with our policies. Because users do not have any ideas about our projects and will make choices unconsciously.
</p>
<p>
  So, first, as designers, we need to explain our projects as clear as possible to the users in order to make them understand what they will do next step and what they will get and provide. The relationship between designers and users is equal. If we ignore to tell sufficient information to the users, it is also a kind of powerful dominance.
</p>
<p>
  As is mentioned in the book Building Consentful Tech, the FRIES can solve the unequal and asymetric information between users and designers. But it sill need to be polished. For example, it is difficult for users to use it by their own wills but not be affected by their friends or families. Maybe the inter-accessiblity among various apps could solve this problem.
