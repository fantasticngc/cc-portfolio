      It is interesting to combine different parts of stories into a new one. This project makes use of this funny method to create a surrealistic drawing to tell a fantastic story, which creates an unexpected experience about narrative. Three people will exchange the upper-body and lower-body, creating a new character's story of an exquisite corpse-like Frankenstein.

      First, I drew an illustration in Photoshop. This is a punk girl who loves electronic music very much. She always takes her bass with her wherever she goes because she gets used to creating music immediately when she get some inspiration. This girl loves fashion but still not cares about her apparel very much. She believes that what makes herself good and comfortable is the most crucial thing in her life.

  New story:
</p>
<p>
     The upper body is a bear's belly. The punk girl is in a bear's costume like a mascot performer. She always plays music in front of the children's playground. As the corpse's lower body looks like a chicken, the punk girl chose to transform and change her legs to chicken legs like machine legs, which were very popular in the era of cyberpunk. This new prosthetic will provide her with the super ability to tap the rhythm with her feet.

  Reflection
</h1>
<p>
  In this week's project, I realized that it was crucial to keep my code neat and clean. And to reach this goal, defining a function is a super convenient way. Because every step and every object can be clearly called in the code, not just a long list of instructions. So if I define a function once, I can use it every time once I call it and I do not need to write it again.
</p>
<p>
  This process reminds me of object-oriented programming and procedure-oriented programming. In this week's drawing, I defined some functions for some shapes and set some parameters about their colors, positions, and rotation angles. So it was much more convenient for me to use the same shapes in the draw function and change these parameters. If I use the drawing process to describe my code, I will draw some similar shapes and use more lines of code. But the procedure-oriented programming also has its own advantages in that it is clear to describe the whole process.
</p>
<p>
  For the storytelling of this project, it is interesting to combine different and even unrelated stories to create a new one. The randomness can bring some unexpected funny results. And the new text stories can be expressed by the new collages of pictures.
