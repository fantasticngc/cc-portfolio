      Autobiography is a good way for us to tell a story about a person. And using the interactive way to tell a story can make the storytelling more immersive and interesting. This story can reveal a lot about our interests, values, and history.

  <p>
    Main Character
  </p>
  <p>
    The protagonist is a time traveler who gone through all his life from old to young, which is like 2001: a space odyssey. All his life will be described as several rooms recording his life experiences. And in every room, the player will find a path to the destination of the black stone. In these rooms, the players will find some obstacles and encourages on the way.

  </br>
  </br>
  <p>
    In the beginging, the room is like a tutorial for all the levels. The room is a nursing home. Players will use wsad to control the protagonist and find which way is the right way to get to the destination. There are a lot of objects, like doors, drawers, which the player can choose to travle to another game scence such as the youth time. And in the middle of the way, players will find some objects on the ground which can tell him what happened in the whole life of the protagonist.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the middle, the room looks like an office where the protaginist worked when he was young. He found that although his life was not such sattisfing, all the memories made him feel that his youth age was like only a moment. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end, the room is a classroom when he was about 10 years old. He played with his friends, sometimes quarrelled with his parents. All these memories are beautiful and raise the emotions of the protagonist.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Finally, when the protagonist find the black stone, one meaning is that the life of the old man comes to an end. Another meaning is that he becomes one part of the universe and like a baby comes back to the mother's womb.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the between of every room, sometimes, the protagonist will go back to the previous scene to find the correct way to monolith.

  <p>
The monolith represents the goals we pursue in our whole life. The time traveller is everyone of us. When we get older and older and look back to the days we have gone through, our life is like a proccess seeking for the monolith. It might be meaningful but also meaningless.

<p>
  This game use WSAD to control the movement of the protagonist.
</p>
<p>
  I designed some objects which can tell the story of the protagonist, such as the doors, notebooks, desks and paintings. These objects can use class and use them in the different scenes to tell a story by the different positions and descriptions of the objects. 
</p>
<p>
  Then I set the start, end and 4 game scenes. The players can find the descriptions of the objects to find the monolith through the hints provided by the notebooks and other objects. In this searching proccess, players will compose their own stories by collecting these fractual elements of narratives.
</p>
<p>
  As these scenes are like memories in the protagonist brain, there are not true orders of these scenes. And the players can fly in the air due to the protagonist is an astronaut.
</p>

<h1>
  Reflection
</h1>
<p>
  In the process of making this game, I fount out a way about how to make a game and iterate it in a gradual proccess. And I think the grey box is the most important part in the designing. It is like a section to show how the game works and what is the main mechanic. The paintings and sketches of the scenes will provide a main visual impression about the game's feeling. 
</p>
<p>
  When deciding the main apperance of the game, it would be much easier for me to finish other parts of the game. The theme of the game will not be scattered.
</p>
<p>
  Besides, I learned how to use class to define an object. When we need to use an object over and over again, it is much more convenient to use object-oriented programming than proccess-oriented programming. This reminds me of what I learned in UE4. I always create a class and then use an instance to create similar but still different things in the engine. 
</p>
<p>
  The walking simulator game is a good choice for designers to tell a story by using interaction rather than just boring texts. This narrative method can provide players with a more immersive experiece to understand the background of the virtual world.
