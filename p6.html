      Everyone has various habits. The habits data looks like an abstract portrait to show the personalities. When collecting these statistics, I feel if using the same method to track different people, there would be differnet fluctuations among people to people. These fluctuations are very interesting nuances for people.

      Design Process
    </h1>
    <p>
      I chose the time I sit on my chair everyday to track. I usually sit on my chair and have little excercise. It is not a good habit so I want to record my sitting hours to demonstrate the data and reminds me to stand up to stretch my body sometimes.
    </p>
   <p>
     So below is my sitting hours data of one week. Unit: Hour
  </p>
  Tuseday 2.1, 3.5, 1.1, 3.5, 3, 3.9 </br>
  Wednesday 3.8, 3.1, 4.2, 5.3</br>
  Thursday 3.5, 2.1, 1.5, 0.3, 0.5, 5, 6.1</br>
  Friday 2.2, 3.1, 5.5, 2.1, 1.4, 0.3, 3</br>
  Saturday 1.3, 2.5, 3.4, 3.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3, 2</br>
  Sunday 2.2, 0.5, 3, 4, 2.2, 3.5, 2, 3.5</br>
  Monday 2.5, 0.5, 4, 0.2, 1, 1.2, 1.3, 5, 6</br>

<p>
  I drew a sketch to show the what the data mean in this picture.
</p>
    <img

<p>
    The inside circles means earlier day and outside circles are late days. The same color rectangles are the same day data and the clockwise rotation means from morning to night. If the rectangles are longer, the hours I sit on my chair is longer.
    </p>
<p>
  In order to see the overlapped data, I changed the opacity of every rectangle and make them rotate around the center in different speeds. The later data will rotate more quickly. When the mouse hovers on the canvas, you will see the data rotating.
</p>

<p>
     When clicking the canvas, it will rotate counterclockwise.

  Reflection
</h1>
<p>
  Data visulization is a silent way to express everything in the world straightly. In this project, I tracked my sitting time everyday to reminds me of that it was also important to have aexcercise everyday. It is not healthy just sitting on the chair for a long time. Although I was told about this words usually, I still did not want to change my habit dut to my laziness. I thought it was not such a long time for me to sit. However, the data I tracked showed me that I would sit on my chair over 12 hours most of the days. And I barely stand up for 5 hours. So when I realized this data, I tried to stand up after about 1 hour or half a hour.
</p>
<p>
  Hence, data as a language is powerful and effective to show the facts. It not only talks about the statistic numbers themselves, the relationships between numbers also express the personalities and characteristics of a person. When the internet collects our personal data, on the one hand, it can recommend us some related and effective information. However, on the other hand, it will also cause the potential danger of information leakages. How to use the information we meet everyday is a question deserving to considering.
</p>
<p>
  Besides, how to talk about data wisely is a subject issue as well. Collecting data, organizing data, and filtering data all can lead to some nuances of data. Data itself is objective, but the people who choose the data will produce different meaning of the original materials.
