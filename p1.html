      </p> 
      
      <p>
        This work explores the ambiguity of humans' language and the gap between computers and human beings. As a pair of partners, we exchanged the description of one object in our memory. And according to the plain languages, we need to draw this object with p5.js.
      </p>
        Partner's Object Description:
          <p>
            It's a doll from my best friend in kindergarten. She made a light pink rabbit with non-woven fabric. The rabbit poses simply with hands and legs stretching straightly outward, while the head holds one-third of the body with two long ears standing on top.
      </p>
          
          <p>
          Ears are pretty much as long as the face is, and she added minor white ovals decoration on the inside of each ear.
          </p>
          <p>
        On the face, a pair of chunky eyes consist of bigger white circles at the bottom and smaller black circles above; an upside-down triangle black nose with a red line mouth as the letter W below. On both sides of the cheeks, two white whiskers made of chenille stems paralleling like an equal symbol.
As for the body, the rabbit is wearing a white square neck sleeveless dress with a semicircle grey pocket on the stomach. Hands and legs are all light pink ovals.
          </p>

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        According to my partner's description, I drew a doll in Photoshop at first to analyze what primitives I needed and what were the primitives' colors, sizes and positions. Then I transferred my drawing into pseudocode to mimic my drawing in Photoshop. Here is my Photoshop sketch below.
      </p>

        />
      </div>

      <p>
        Pseudocode:
      </p>
  <p>
    Draw a circle as a head and fill them in light pink
  </p>
  <p>
Draw two ellipse as ears and both ellipse are mirrored
  </p>
  <p>
Draw two circles as eyes and fill them in black
  </p>
<p>
Draw four ellipse as limbs and fill them in light pink
  </p>
  <p>  
Draw a triangle in the middle of the head and fill it in black
  </P>
<p>
Draw two 180 degrees arcs as the mouth and the stroke is red
</p>
<p>
Draw two white horizontal lines on each side of the face as whiskers
  </p>

      <p>
        My partner's language describes the object very clearly and accurately. She elucidated her doll of her kindergarten age and every part of the doll was every concrete. I interpreted her description into several primitives and I drew them in Photoshop at first. It is easy to draw a doll made up with primitives by hand. But when I transfer it into code, this process  will be much more complex. But drawing in Photoshop can help me to define the RGB value conveniently.
      </p>
  
       <p>
         In the process of coding, I realized that human's language was less accurate than computer language even if we tried to make it more exact. We seldom describe an object with its accurate size, color and position when talking. But computer language must need these parameters to understand what humans mean. The differences between two languages are the magic of programming itself.
